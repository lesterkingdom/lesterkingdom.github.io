Hello, world!
I am a Master student at Emory University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Robert Lyles]. I obtained my bachelor's degree in statistics from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research interest lies in Deep Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, Multi-agent RL, and Causal Inference. Logic is all your need.

*NLP Track: Extracting Biomedical Knowledge in COVID-19 literatures* (https://github.com/lesterkingdom/Extracting_Biomedical_Knowledge)

*Causal Inference: Using Targeted Learning to Analyze the Influence Mechanism of Sleep*
